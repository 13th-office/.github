# Reading Challenge
## Juan Pablo Pérez Durán | A01639947

- **Books:** *The Unicorn Project: A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data*
- **Reading plan:** 20 minutes a day for 5 weeks

Besides that book I'm already reading a book called '*Red Roulete: An Insider's Story of Wealth, Power, Corruption, and Vengeance in Today's China*' which is very interesting. I'm spending about 10 minutes a day on that book.
