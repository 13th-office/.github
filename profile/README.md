# 13th Office

![13th Office logo](/profile/logo.png)

13th Office's vision centers around two key principles: **good user experience** and **efficiency**. We believe that in today's fast-paced world, users should not have to sacrifice ease of use for productivity, nor productivity for ease of use.

Our mission is to create software that balance these two goals, empowering users to achieve their goals with intuitive, innovative solutions.

## Our Values
We have a cluster of values as individuals, and the objective that unites the 13th Office as a high efficency team is **compromise**. For success and attainment compromise is a key factor to a well developed project.
We believe that compromise is correlated to the **responsability** that means planning and developing quality software.
